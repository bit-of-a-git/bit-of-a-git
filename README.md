### Hi there, I'm David! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on Python, Devops, and Cloud.

- ðŸ“« You can reach me at: 92552641+bit-of-a-git@users.noreply.github.com - easy to remember, right?

- âš¡ I am interested in solving puzzles, security, and learning new things about coding.

- ðŸŒ± The project I'm most proud of so far is my Secure Passphrase Generator, which you can find [here](https://github.com/bit-of-a-git/Secure-Passphrase-Generator). I plan to continually update and improve upon it.
