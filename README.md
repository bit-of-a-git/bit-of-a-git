### Hi there, I'm David! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working as a Cloud & DevOps Engineer with Deloitte Ireland. I am experienced in a variety of AWS resources, IaC tools such as Terraform and CloudFormation, and containerisation tools such as Docker and Kubernetes.

- ðŸ“« You can find my Cloud Resume Challenge [here](davidoconnor.me), which has my contact details. Alternatively you can reach me at: 92552641+bit-of-a-git@users.noreply.github.com - easy to remember, right?

- âš¡ I am interested in solving puzzles, security, and learning new things about coding. Outside of tech my interests include travel, photography, music, culture, and reading.

- ðŸŒ± The project I'm most proud of so far is my submission for the Cloud Resume Challenge, a challenge created by Google's Forrest Brazeal. You can find my blog about it [here](https://dev.to/bit-of-a-git/a-security-focused-cloud-resume-challenge-16aa) along with the repos [here](https://github.com/bit-of-a-git/cloud-resume-challenge-back-end) and [here](https://github.com/bit-of-a-git/cloud-resume-challenge-front-end).
