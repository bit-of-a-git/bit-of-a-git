### Hi there, I'm David! 👋

- 🛠️ I am currently working as a Cloud & DevOps Engineer with Deloitte Ireland. I have built development environments, worked on cloud migrations, and taken part in automation projects.

- 🚀 I am experienced in a variety of AWS resources, IaC tools such as Terraform and CloudFormation, and containerisation tools such as Docker and Kubernetes.

- 🌠 I am additionally experienced with programming and scripting languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, and Bash. I use Arch btw (well, Debian at least!)

- 🎯 You can find my Cloud Resume Challenge [here](https://www.davidoconnor.me), which has my contact details. Alternatively you can reach me at: 92552641+bit-of-a-git@users.noreply.github.com - easy to remember, right?

- ⚡ I am interested in solving puzzles, security, and learning new things about coding. Outside of tech my interests include travel, photography, music, culture, and reading.

- 🌱 The project I am proudest of so far is my submission for the Cloud Resume Challenge, a challenge created by Google's Forrest Brazeal. You can find my blog about it [here](https://dev.to/bit-of-a-git/a-security-focused-cloud-resume-challenge-16aa) along with the repos [here](https://github.com/bit-of-a-git/cloud-resume-challenge-back-end) and [here](https://github.com/bit-of-a-git/cloud-resume-challenge-front-end).
